		Basic instructions:
			- if the current step is STEP_MST, then call prim's MST to get a tree and color the edges
			- if the current step is STEP_DFT, then perform a DFT of the tree to get a visit order
			- uncomment the code for (step >= STEP_DFT) to highlight the DFT step-by-step
			- yes, you can write helper methods!
		
		Details for MST step:
			- you should store the tree from Prim's algorithm in the appropriate
				tree variable (see above section of code)
			- you do NOT need to implement Prim's MST algorithm, the JUNG library
				already has this built in! see documentation on this here:
				http://jung.sourceforge.net/doc/api/edu/uci/ics/jung/algorithms/shortestpath/MinimumSpanningForest.html
			- short version of using the above class:
				(1) construct an instance of MinimumSpanningForest
				(2) call getForest() on that instance (returns a tree of the right type)
			- parameters for a MinimumSpanningForest:
				(1) a graph -- you have one of these
				(2) a new tree -- you can create a new DelegateForest using the
					default constructor (see: http://jung.sourceforge.net/doc/api/edu/uci/ics/jung/graph/DelegateForest.html)
				(3) the root -- this is your starting city
				(4) a mapping of edges (Flights) to costs (doubles) -- create 
					yourself a HashMap<Flight,Double> for this and fill it with
					all (Flight --> Flight Costs) from your graph
					see http://jung.sourceforge.net/doc/api/edu/uci/ics/jung/graph/Graph.html,
					for on the graph class, especially the parent interface (HyperGraph) methods
			- to color the edges of the tree in the graph, use colorAllEdges() (see above) 
				providing the tree and the color COLOR_ACTIVE_EDGE (from the TSPAlg class)
					
		Details for DFT step:
			- complete the recursive depthFirstTraversal() static method (see
				lower down in this file) and use that to compute the visit order
			- compute the visit order cost after computing the visit order
			- DO NOT FORGET to add in the cost back to the starting city (the
				starting city IS in the tree, so you do NOT need to manually
				add it into the visit order)
			- the visit order list and visit order cost (from the parent
				TSPAlg class) should be set correctly after this step
			- you do NOT need to color the edges for the DFT, that is done
				by the (step >= STEP_DFT) code provided
